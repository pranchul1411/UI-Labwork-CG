   <p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>

   <p>It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. </p>

   <p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.</p>

   <p>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself. </p>
